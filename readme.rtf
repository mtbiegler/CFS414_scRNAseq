This repository contains an RStudio markdown file with the code used to process 10x single-cell RNA 
sequencing data generated from the CFS414 zebra finch cell line at passage 24 and passage 50. There 
is an additional .zip file containing .csv files used in this markdown file.

The scRNAseq files will be uploaded to GEO and linked here, but in the meantime are available by request
